# PERN TODO LIST

Super simple PERN stack project. 

Backend of Node, Express and PostgreSQL. 

Frontend using React and Material UI.

## Purpose

Based on a YouTube tutorial for the PERN stack

Tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8

Project differs from the tutorial though the usage of Material UI and creating a better user experience through not reloading the page on each CRUD operation. 

## Note

This project was for educational purposes to become familiar with full stack development with React.
